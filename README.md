# What is a MobileGestalt?
It refers to a modular and dynamic system architecture commonly used in mobile operating systems ‚Äì particularly within iOS ‚Äì to manage device-specific configurations and capabilities.

In a more abstract sense, a Mobilegestalt represents the "identity" of a mobile device: its hardware features, system behaviors, sensor availability, and functional flags. Instead of hardcoding device capabilities, Apple uses Mobilegestalt to dynamically query and manage these properties, making the system more adaptable to a wide range of hardware models.
It is also used by rootless tweaks or other low-level tools to query or modify device-specific properties for customization, debugging, or enabling hidden system features.

# compatibility
Accessing MobileGestalt data ‚Äî such as device model identifiers, hardware capabilities, and system-level information ‚Äî was possible without jailbreak using Apple Shortcuts or third-party apps (e.g., Scriptable, Toolbox Pro) up until iOS 17.0.3.

‚úÖ Last Supported Version
iOS 17.0.3 is the last confirmed version where MobileGestalt-related data could be accessed via shortcuts or automation apps without root or jailbreak access.
‚ùå What Changed After iOS 17.0.3?
Starting with iOS 17.1, Apple implemented stricter sandboxing and security policies, which blocked access to many internal device APIs and system identifiers ‚Äî including those that expose MobileGestalt keys.

As a result:

Device model identifiers (e.g., iPhone15,2)
Hardware capability flags (e.g., Face ID support)
Low-level hardware queries
...are no longer accessible from Shortcuts or automation environments.

üîê Why Did Apple Block It?
Apple likely enforced these changes to:

Improve privacy and device fingerprinting protection
Prevent unauthorized hardware spoofing
Harden the OS against jailbreak development and low-level inspection
üß™ Alternatives (Post iOS 17.1)
To access full MobileGestalt data on iOS 17.1+:

You need a jailbroken device or a running exploit 
Or use developer-level tools with entitlements and Xcode debugging
Or rely on firmware parsing and offline analysis via IPSW files

# Download
You can download the Save MobileGestalt .shortcut file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsxs-dev/Save-MobileGestalt/refs/heads/main/Save%20MobileGestalt%20.zip)

# Usage
Press on the file and download it. After downoad go to files app and click on the file. You will be redirected to the Shortcuts app and have to confirm the shortcut.
After that click on the shortcut and press allow and then select where the MobileGestalt file will save
